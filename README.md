# Local Products Marketplace 

## Overview
Welcome to the local products and short supply chains marketplace project! This platform aims to connect local producers with consumers by providing a simple and efficient solution to discover and purchase quality products, while supporting the local economy and reducing your environmental footprint.

## Context
Local consumption is on the rise, but producers often struggle to find suitable distribution channels. Our marketplace aims to bridge this gap by offering an intuitive and comprehensive platform that meets the needs of both parties:

Producers: A dedicated space to showcase their products, manage their orders, and track their sales.

Consumers: Easy access to a wide range of local products, with advanced search tools and transparent information about the origin of products.

## Objectives
Marketplace: Directly connect producers and consumers.
Advanced filtering: Allow users to quickly find the products they are looking for based on specific criteria (location, product type, certifications, etc.).
Order management: Simplify the ordering and delivery process, with complete traceability.
Producer interface: Provide producers with a clear dashboard to manage their business and analyze their performance.
Analytical tools: Allow consumers to assess the environmental impact of their purchases.
